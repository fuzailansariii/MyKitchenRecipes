      <p className="text-xl font-alata">
        Welcome to My Kitchen, where culinary passion meets creativity! Our
        journey began with a simple belief â€“ that cooking is not just a chore
        but an art form, a source of joy, and a way to create lasting memories.
        My Kitchen is more than just a collection of recipes; it's a community
        where food lovers unite to explore, learn, and share.
